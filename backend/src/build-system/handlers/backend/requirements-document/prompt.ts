Task: Generate a Backend Overview Document following these guidelines:
Project Name: ${projectName}

### Technology Stack
- Language: ${language}
- Framework: ${framework}
- Key Packages: ${JSON.stringify(defaultDependencies)}

### Instructions and Rules:
1. Design a clear system architecture based on the technology stack and requirements
2. Define API endpoints based on:
   - Database entity relationships
   - Frontend data requirements from the DataMap
   - Site structure and navigation flows from the SiteMap
3. Follow RESTful or GraphQL conventions as appropriate
4. Consider:
   - Data flow between frontend pages
   - Required data transformations
5. IMPORTANT: Carefully differentiate between public and authenticated endpoints:
   - Public endpoints (No Auth)
6. For authenticated endpoints only, include authentication in the headers section using "Authorization": "Bearer {token}"
7. Don't add authentication requirements to public-facing read operations (GET requests for viewing content)
8. Do not add login when no documentation mentioned.
9. It MUST be COMPLETE DO NOTE write TODO, and Future for api.

Your reply must start with: "<GENERATE>" and end with "</GENERATE>".

Include these sections:
## API Documentation
Group endpoints by functional areas based on site structure.
For each endpoint:
\`\`\`
Route: GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/resource
Purpose: Functional description
Data Requirements:
  - Required data transformations
Required Auth: No/Yes
Request:
{
  "headers": {},
  "params": {},
  "query": {},
  "body": {}
}
Response:
{
  "success": {},
  "errors": {}
}
\`\`\``;
};

#### 3. Implementation Details
For each major component:
- **Request Handlers/Controllers**
  - Implementation approach
  - Request processing flow
  - Response formatting
  - Middleware integration

- **Business Logic Layer/Services**
  - Service patterns
  - Business rule implementation
  - External service integration
  - Transaction management

- **Data Access Layer**
  - Database interaction patterns
  - Query optimization
  - Data mapping strategy
  - Cache integration

- **Middleware Components**
  - Authentication middleware
  - Validation middleware
  - Logging middleware
  - Error handling middleware

#### 4. Security Implementation
- Authentication strategy
  - Token management
  - Session handling
  - Refresh token mechanism
- Authorization rules
  - Role-based access control
  - Permission management
  - Resource ownership
- Input validation
  - Request validation
  - Data sanitization
- API security
  - Rate limiting
  - CORS configuration
  - Security headers
- Data protection
  - Encryption methods
  - Secure storage
  - PII handling

#### 5. Error Handling
- Error handling strategy
  - Global error handler
  - Domain-specific errors
  - Operational errors
- Error response format
  - Error codes
  - Error messages
  - Debug information
- Error types and codes
  - HTTP status codes
  - Application error codes
  - Validation errors
- Logging strategy
  - Log levels
  - Log format
  - Log storage

Focus on:
1. ${language} and ${framework} specific implementation patterns
2. Best practices for each component
3. Security considerations
4. Error handling and logging
5. Performance optimization`;
